Viraas is a self-hosted, docker based, Heroku-like PaaS with cluster and ARM support.

###### ðŸ˜– What does that even mean?

- ***Self-hosted***: You deploy the [`vira/viraas` docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/vira/viraas) on your own infrastructure, and own everything (work in progress)
- ***Docker based***: Apps are based off of [Docker images](https://docs.docker.com/develop/)
- ***Heroku-like [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service)***: Deploy and manage apps from a [UI (work in progress)](./.github/assets/ui.png) or CLI, similar to Heroku
- [***Cluster***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster): Scale the platform horizontally by using multiple computers/devices to run your apps
- ***ARM support***: In addition to the standard CPU architectures, Viraas is [published with ARM support](https://hub.docker.com/r/vira/viraas/tags)

#### ðŸšª Why is it the "cloud for your closet"?

I originally wrote Viraas as a simple way to deploy apps to some Raspberry Pis in my closet on my local network!

Since then, features have been added to make it an *almost* production ready service.

#### âœ¨ What makes Viraas unique?

- The only self hosted PaaS that supports both **clusters** and **ARM devices**
- Most apps can be deployed with zero config
